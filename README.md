# Scenario and Decision Simulator (v1)

This folder contains the first functional prototype of AgroVision's decision
support simulator for Sprint 03.

The current scope follows `SCOPE_AND_DECISION_LOGIC.md`: the simulator supports
agricultural decision-making by comparing seed density strategies under climate,
soil, productivity, and risk uncertainty.

Crop-specific payoff references are documented in
`PAYOFF_MATRICES_BY_CROP.md`, including the Sprint 02 soybean matrix and the
corn matrix derived from Bayer internal historical records.

## Decision Scope

The simulator compares three seed density strategies:

- `Conservative Strategy`: lower operational risk and more stable productivity.
- `Adaptive Strategy`: balanced productivity and stability.
- `Intensive Strategy`: higher productivity potential with greater risk exposure.

The states of the world are:

- `C1 - Favorable`: stable rainfall and ideal conditions.
- `C2 - Moderate`: some instability but manageable production.
- `C3 - Unfavorable`: drought, irregular rainfall, or high operational risk.

## Decision Criteria

Version 1 uses two decision perspectives:

- **Expected Value (primary criterion)**: calculates the weighted average
  productivity for each strategy using forecast-derived scenario probabilities.
  The final recommendation follows the highest Expected Value.
- **Minimax Regret (going beyond)**: compares each strategy's maximum regret
  against the best productivity available in each climate scenario. This is
  displayed as a risk-aware comparison, where lower values are better.

## Configurable Inputs

The interface includes inputs aligned with the new scope:

- region/state;
- crop type;
- soil texture;
- area in hectares;
- planting objective;
- operation type;
- operation speed.

The simulator uses Open-Meteo forecast data for the selected region/state. The
forecast is converted into `C1 - Favorable`, `C2 - Moderate`, and
`C3 - Unfavorable` probabilities, then passed into the existing Expected Value
and Minimax decision logic.

## Responsibilities

- `app.py`: Streamlit entry point.
- `src/decision_engine.py`: Expected Value, Minimax Regret, and recommendation
  logic.
- `src/input_validation.py`: validation rules for scenario probabilities and
  productivity estimates.
- `src/ui_components.py`: Streamlit screens, explanations, input controls,
  visualizations, and recommendation output.
- `src/data/historical_indicators.py`: local reference indicators derived from
  the CSV files in `data/`.
- `tests/test_decision_engine_manual.py`: manual verification checks for the
  decision formulas.

## Run Locally

```bash
cd "Sprint 03/Scenario and Decision Simulator (v1)"
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

## Manual Verification

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 "Sprint 03/Scenario and Decision Simulator (v1)/tests/test_decision_engine_manual.py"
```

## Notes

- Historical Insights refers to historical agricultural dataset context, not
  user search history or saved simulation history.
- The deployment folder must include `data/planting_summary_brazil.csv` and
  `data/harvest_summary_brazil.csv`.
- The current reference logic is centralized in `src/data/` so it is not
  scattered through the interface.
- A full database is not required for this Sprint 03 prototype.
